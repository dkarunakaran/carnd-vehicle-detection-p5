### Decscription

In this project, goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video. 

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

I haven't included the dataset in the repo. Please use below links to download the dataset.

Here are links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train your classifier.  These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.   You are welcome and encouraged to take advantage of the recently released [Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) to augment your training data.  


As part of the optional challenge, I have added the project 4(https://github.com/dkarunakaran/carnd-advanced-lane-lines-p4) implementation to this. For the detailed explanation of the project4, Please visit my [medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/self-driving-car-nanodegree-advanced-lane-finding-9c806b277a31) post.

I was excited to apply this in real world. Here is the [youtube link]() of the car detection and advanced lane finding projects application in Sydney road.
